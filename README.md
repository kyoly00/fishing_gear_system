# 🐟 Smart Lost Fishing Gear Reporting and Retrieval System

This system helps **fishermen**, **administrators**, and **collection ships** to collaboratively manage and retrieve lost fishing gear using **real-time reporting**, **drift simulation**, and **sediment prediction**.

---

## 1. 🎣 Fishermen report lost fishing gear with one click

Fishermen press a button on-site when they lose fishing gear during operations.

---

## 2. 📍 The reported location is automatically recorded on the web page

A web dashboard displays the gear's loss location in real-time.

## 3. 🌀 Loss simulation predicts gear movement

Administrators can run a **drift simulation** from the reported location to estimate the future position of the gear.

---

## 4. 🗺️ Simulated location is visualized on the map

The predicted end location is visualized to assist in planning retrieval operations.

## 5. 🚢 Assigning collection ships to retrieve the lost gear

Administrators assign the most suitable collection ship based on location and availability.

## 6. 🪸 Sediment simulation predicts long-term deposition zones

If gear remains unretrieved, sedimentation simulations help estimate **long-term accumulation areas**.
